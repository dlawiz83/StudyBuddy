## How It Works
The extension injects a friendly “buddy” onto supported sites.  
It detects actions like **Run** and **Submit**, tracks coding activity, and awards XP in real time using `chrome.storage.sync`.

A popup UI (coming soon) will show:
- XP bar  
- Level  
- Buddy cosmetics

##  Tech Stack
- Chrome Extension (Manifest V3)  
- JavaScript
- React + Vite (for popup UI)
- Tailwind CSS (styling)
- Content Scripts  
- chrome.storage  
- MutationObserver
